//stdarg.h is a C standard library header that provides support for functions that take a variable number of arguments. 
//It defines a set of macros and types that are used to work with variable argument lists. 
//The key macros defined in this header are va_start, va_arg, va_end, and va_list.

//va_list is a type that is used to declare a variable that will hold the information required to traverse the list of arguments. 
//This variable is passed to va_start to initialize it.

//va_start is a macro that is used to initialize a va_list variable to the first argument in the variable argument list. 
//It takes two arguments: the va_list variable and the name of the last fixed argument in the function.

//va_arg is a macro that is used to access the next argument in the variable argument list. 
//It takes a va_list variable as its argument and returns the next argument as a specified type.

//va_end is a macro that is used to clean up after using a va_list variable. 
//It takes a va_list variable as its argument and should be called before the function returns.

//These macros are used in conjunction to iterate through the variable argument list, allowing a function to process its variable arguments in a type-safe manner. 
//It is commonly used to implement functions like printf or scanf which take variable number of arguments.
